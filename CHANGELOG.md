# Changelog

Every release is one commit on `main` whose subject is the version (`vX.Y.Z`),
tagged with the same name. Entries below are newest first. The `v0.x` and
`v1.x` entries each cover a phase of the early development line rather than a
single change.

## v0.4.0 — 2026-08-04 – 2026-08-05

Release engineering, one terminal experience for the installer family, and a
repository that tells the truth about the product it contains.

- **Fresh VM1 installability restored.** The `packages/knowledge` manifest is
  copied into the api and worker images so a frozen-lockfile install can resolve
  the workspace graph again, and compose runs postgres on a pgvector image
  matching CI, so the migrator can create the extension.
  `test-docker-build-closure.sh` and `test-release-consistency.sh` join CI as
  guards.
- **`scripts/lib/installer-ui.sh` becomes the canonical installer UI**, embedded
  verbatim in the self-contained scripts between markers, with
  `sync-installer-ui.sh --check` as the drift test. Role accents distinguish the
  scripts, VM1 becomes a six-step flow with preflight checks and a secret-free
  install log, and the remover carries its own `INSTALLER_VERSION` — a twelfth
  release surface the consistency test enforces.
- **The Business Source License 1.1** is adopted, converting to Apache-2.0 per
  release after four years, alongside SECURITY.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, this
  changelog, and issue and pull-request templates.
- The README and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` are rewritten for the real architecture —
  document knowledge in a local pgvector index, originals never retained — and
  the audit trail and SIEM forwarding are documented for the first time. The
  README gains a branded architecture diagram and a rendering of the installer's
  own output.
- Every install command shortens to the canonical `curl -fsSL` form, guarded in
  `test-release-consistency.sh` so the verbose spelling cannot return.

## v0.3.0 — 2026-08-04

The audit era: the trail written from every governed path became readable,
forwardable and observable.

- `GET /api/v1/admin/audit/events` behind the `audit:read` scope, keyset-paged
  with exact-match filters, and an Audit trail view under Operations.
- SIEM forwarding with a keyset cursor and at-least-once delivery, forwarding
  health reported as `HEALTHY`/`BEHIND`/`FAILING`/`NOT_CONFIGURED`, and an AI-Ops
  component that opens an incident when the destination rejects batches.
- Conversation-scoped knowledge: documents pin to a conversation
  (`ChatConversationDocument`, `AgentRun.knowledgeDocumentIds`), with a chat
  Knowledge picker and the dashboard's first jsdom interaction test.
- `SUPPORTED_DOCUMENT_TYPES` becomes the single source of truth binding the
  upload picker, the 415-rejecting upload route and the extractor.
- Onboarding becomes completable from the dashboard — architecture decision,
  component attestation and the activation control — and operations reaps stale
  executors on a timer. Dead code from the ORM and retrieval transitions is
  removed, including `ToolActionDispatch` and `DocumentMemoryPublication`.

## v0.2.0 — 2026-08-04

The Drizzle and local-knowledge era.

- Every manager, the worker and the inference gateway move from Prisma to Drizzle
  ORM against a structurally verified baseline migration, and Prisma is removed
  entirely. Data-layer tests run against real per-file migrated PostgreSQL
  databases.
- Enterprise document knowledge moves from Supermemory into a local pgvector
  index: `DocumentChunk` with 1024-dimension BGE-M3 embeddings, HNSW cosine
  retrieval, in-flight extraction, and originals never stored.
- Worker run durability is hardened: approval-state discovery, slot-based
  dispatch, honest shutdown, history-trim correctness and lease release.

## v0.1.0 — 2026-07-30 – 2026-08-04

The foundation series: the two-VM product took shape.

- VM1 control plane — Fastify API, React dashboard, worker, PostgreSQL via Docker
  Compose — with envelope-encrypted secrets, local administrator provisioning,
  the offline Installation Key and the public one-line bootstrap.
- VM2 Agentic System enrollment: Ed25519 node identity, one-time claims, signed
  replay-protected heartbeats, a digest-pinned Hermes container,
  checksum-verified Supermemory Local, a resumable recovery journal and the
  decommission flow.
- Governed Hermes-first Chat with durable Agent Runs, immutable Profile
  distributions, prompts, guardrails, model routes, the node-scoped inference
  gateway, operations/incidents/evidence, and OIDC enterprise access.
